4. Steps to Create Github Page
	4.1 Accept assignment
	4.2 Clone repository created by assignment
	4.3 Change visibility of repository to public, then select which part of branch will be used to host the website
5. It can be quite difficult to format items the way you want with HTML, and it takes both talent and creativity to create a good website.
